OVERVIEW

GeneWeb comprises two servers (programs that receive requests from the web
browser and return information to it):
 - gwsetup:
     manages data bases: creating, deleting, renaming, merging,
     importing/exporting GEDCOM and so on.
 - gwd:
     provides the ability to read a data base, make changes, compute
     relationships, display ancestors and so on.

  The servers are just programs running in windows. You don't need to pay
  attention to them, but as long as you are using GeneWeb, you must not
  close their windows. In any case, they are launched minimized.

  Everything is done in your favorite Web browser, which carries on a dialog
  with these programs using the internet protocol. But you normally don't need
  to be connected to the Web.

START

  To start GeneWeb, just double-click on the gwsetup icon and then on
  the gwd icon. They should appear in the task bar, at the bottom of the
  screen.

  Then double-click on "START.htm" to bring up your browser. It
  gives you a URL to click on in order to connect to the gwsetup service.

STOP

  To stop, close the gwsetup and gwd windows. If you left them minimized,
  use the right button of your mouse for this operation. Windows might say
  that data may be lost. Don't worry about it. Just ignore this message.
  Nothing is lost.

All the applications, including this README, can also be launched from the
"Start" button, "Programs" Menu, "GeneWeb-xxx".
